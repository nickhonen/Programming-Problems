# Programming-Problems
Documenting my progress on coding challenges. 

Trying to analyze patterns, hone my problem-solving process, and hopefully see improvements!

*Update 4-3-22:* Ended up taking the last month to focus on more practical programming as opposed to problem solving, but now I'm back. I don't want to go crazy with this, just want a repo to track everything. Not gonna go crazy with tracking metrics like last time. Gonna be working my way through some curated leetcode list and just learning more about algorithms/data structures as I see them in problems. I have a bit more of a fundamental understanding of algorithmic complexity now, so I should be better equipped this time.

## Exercises for Programmers
**Update 3-2-22:** This book is pretty great. Basically has a ton of real world challenges, that are all incredibly solvable and applicable. Just a damn good way to practice fundamentals of a language. The best part about this book for me is the challenges Brian Hogan provides for each problem really helps me strengthen oft-neglected areas of my programming knowledge, such as error-handling and making a GUI. This just helps me tie everything together and work on many different problems at once, as opposed to just practicing Javascript syntax. Will be working through this for the forseeable future.
## Data Structure Study Plan
**Update 3-2-22:** So I was a bit in over my head with this, but these were my early attempts at solving the Data Structures study plan with Leetcode. I will absolutely go back and do this in a month or two, but I simply was/am not ready yet. I feel like Leetcode in general should be used only after you have a solid fundamental understanding of DSAA, and I simply don't have that yet. Keeping it here because I'm excited to come back to it.
