# Programming-Problems
Documenting my progress on coding challenges. 

Trying to analyze patterns, hone my problem-solving process, and hopefully see improvements!

Started focusing on Data Structures more as of 2-16, and started the leetcode Data Structures study plan. All progress will be posted here, hoping to finish before the end of the month.
